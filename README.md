# 3D Menu

## A 3D Menu is a form of virtual interface with elements inside a form of 3D space through which the user interacts with the system.

### A good example is the 3D options display in Smart TVs

### The design is carried out in the following steps:

#### - Created a html file titled index.html

#### - The DOM was then created using html:5 syntax

#### - font awesome cdn was installed in the head section

#### - style.css and script.js files were linked to the index.html file

#### - A '.container' div was created in the body section

#### - A '.menu' div was entered as a child of the parent '.container'

#### - five div siblings '.menu-items' were entered as children of the '.menu' div.

#### - the 'i' elements were introduced to represent each icon displayed on the screen.

#### - the DOM was styled using css.

#### - the display/hidden effects and other interactivity and functionalities were made possible using JavaScript.
